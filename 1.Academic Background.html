						<h2>Bachelors of Science in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (February, 2020 - March, 2025)</h2>
						<h4>Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</h4>
						<h3>Dhaka, Bangladesh</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						I graduated with a CGPA of 3.66/4.00 majoring in Communications and Signal Processing
						while scoring 3.90/4.00 in the last semester. BUET taught me a lot of things besides things pertaining to what
						I majored in. But the most important things would be to the courage to face the difficulties
						of life, academic or personal, and to be understanding to everyone as we do not know their struggles fully. It also made me accept that it was not possible to know everything, but
						what mattered was the ability to learn anything that was required for any task at hand. I might also add
						that I was CR from Level-1, Term-1 to Level-3, Term-2 and was awared a <a href="pdfs\Academic\CR certificate.pdf">certificate</a>.

						<h2>Higher School Certificate in Science (June, 2017 - 2019)</h2>
						<h4>Notre Dame College</h4>
						<h3>Dhaka, Bangladesh</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						I passed my HSC from Science division, English Version, with a GPA of 5.00/5.00 in all subjects,
						ranking 98th in Dhaka Board with talentpool scholarship. I was also awarded a <a href="pdfs\Academic\NDC Perfect attendance certificate.pdf">Perfect attendance certificate</a>. 
						I think other fellow Notredamians would agree with me when I say that this was perhaps
						one of the best 2 years our lives. What I would give to relive them!
